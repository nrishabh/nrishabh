## Hello! ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm a CS grad student who wants to work on things he finds interesting - thatâ€™s it. 

What do I find interesting? Machine learning models, computer vision applications, analytical techniques used to explore data from the James Webb Telescope, NLU systems used in call analysis, autoencoders used to find anomalies in jet particle data from CERNâ€™s Large Hadron Collider, trends and patterns in healthcare, using AI for social impact - the list goes on.
